How the internet works.

    The internet is basically a cable. One long cable that physically connects all computers in the world. 
The computer that you use is actually called a client.Your computer(client) connects to a router, this 
router takes your client IP address and sends it to the modem. The modem then connects to your internet
service provider or ISP. The ISP then moves to the router of the website you're looking for.
    
    The router of the website you are searching for connects to the server hub. The server hub holds
a massive array of data hard drives that store the information and databases for the webpsite. 

What happens when you click on a link. 

    When you click on a link, your computer(client) sends a request for the link through your server and 
modem and into your ISP. When your ISP receives the request it sends the request through a resolver to the 
root client. The root then contacts the TLD where the registrar information is stored on the Authoritative
name server. The TLD then finds the correct IP address for the domain name submitted and provides that to 
the root. 
    The root then returns with the correct IP address for the website you are searching for. The root then
Tells the Operating system the correct IP address for the clients submission. The browser on your computer(client)
then requests information from the provided IP address and requests HTML, CSS and Javascript information. The server
sends this information in packets to display on the browser.
